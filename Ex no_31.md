## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program to find the smallest among three numbers using Structure.

## Algorithm
Start.
Define a variables a,b,c.
Write program to find the smallest among the three numbers.
Read the value using scanf.
Ask the user to make an input.

{
int a,b,c; 
scanf("%d%d%d",&a,&b,&c); 
if(a<b && a<c)
{
printf("%d is the smallest number.",a);
}
else if(b<a && b<c)
{
printf("%d is the smallest number.",b);
}
else
{
printf("%d is the smallest number.",c);
}
}
```
